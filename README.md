This is a 2025-2026 UCF Senior Design Project led by CS students in collaboration with UCF's College of Medicine to design an app that assess patients' fall risk and guides them toward safer intervention through the PEER intervention method.

## Get started



1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/munishbp/AI-PEER
   cd AI-PEER
   npm install

   cp .env.example .env

   #Edit with your own MongoDB credentials
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo
